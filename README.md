# IO_signature_bias
Investigating immune-oncology signature bias related to demographic variables 

This repository supports a comprehensive analysis of bias in published immune-oncology (IO) gene signatures and their relationship with key demographic and clinical variables, such as age and sex, in the context of IO therapy response.

🔍 Overview
IO_signature_bias aims to:

Evaluate demographic bias (e.g., sex, age) in IO gene signatures

Assess how these biases influence IO therapy response

Enable reproducible analysis using curated datasets and gene signatures
